DO NOT EDIT THIS BRANCH. See the README in the Staging branch for the new workflow on how to commit changes. Anyone who sees a pull-request for a commit to this branch that is not a merge from staging, should close it and remind the requester that only merges from staging are allowed to be committed to this branch.
Use the staging branch to make updated to existing pages and indices. If you wish to add a new page or make substantial changes to the site, make a new branch from this one and call it Staging_"Your feature". Once you have made your changes to your feature branch, pull request a merge from your feature branch to the staging branch. Once you wish to push a change to the site, pull request a merge from the staging branch to the Main branch. Then you can run the ftp action on the Main branch. All pull requests will require two people to approve the merge. DO NOT RUN FTP ACTIONS ON BRANCHES THAT ARE NOT MAIN.
